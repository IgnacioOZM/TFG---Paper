# OPTIMIZATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL VISION SYSTEM OF AN INDUSTRIAL ROBOT FOR A PICK AND PLACE APPLICATION
In the past two years Comillas ICAI has been developing a system capable of endowing artificial vision and autonomy to it’s robots. This robots have to be capable of identifying and recollecting
LEGO pieces randomly set at a work bench. This project takes upon this previous work done by Ana Berjón Valles to improve it. To do so, we have first upgraded the current segmentation
system base on colour masking, edge detection and the Hough transform. Also the systems designed to analyse the depth and rotation of the pieces has been redesigned and upgraded.
However, despite this upgrades our system is still incapable to compete with the modern systems already well implanted in the industry. This new systems are based on convolutional neuronal
networks. As it’s name indicates this networks are based on the principles of convolution and deep learning. Because of it we have decided to upgrade the robots with this new technologies
and improve it’s capabilities.
